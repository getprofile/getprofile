title: Adaptive Tutor / Learning Companion
description: "AI tutors that adapt to each student's learning style and progress"
---

## Scenario

AI tutor for language, math, or coding inside a learning platform that needs to adapt to individual student needs.

## Extraction

From student questions, answers, and exercises, GetProfile keeps traits like:

- `skill_level` per topic: vocab, grammar, integrals, recursion…
- `learning_style`: prefers step-by-step vs big-picture explanations
- `common_mistakes[]`: typical grammar/calc errors
- `motivation_pattern`: often gives up early vs pushes through

It updates these as the student improves or regresses.

## Injection

Before each tutoring LLM call, GetProfile injects:

- Profile summary:
  - "Intermediate grammar, weak with conditionals; prefers concrete examples; often confused by abstract explanations."

- A few **targeted memories**:
  - last explanation that worked,
  - last couple of failed attempts on the same concept.

## Impact

The tutor can:

- Choose the right difficulty and explanation style.
- Remind the student of previous successful strategies.
- Avoid re-trying explanations that already failed.

## Implementation

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
apiKey: process.env.GETPROFILE_API_KEY,
baseURL: 'https://api.yourserver.com/v1',
defaultHeaders: {
'X-GetProfile-Id': "student-456",
'X-Upstream-Key': process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
},
});

// Tutoring session
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
model: 'gpt-5',
messages: [
{
role: 'system',
content: 'You are a patient tutor. Adapt your explanations to the student\'s learning style.',
},
{
role: 'user',
content: 'I still don\'t understand conditional statements in Python.',
},
],
});
// GetProfile injects student's skill level, learning style, and past attempts
