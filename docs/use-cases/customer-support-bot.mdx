title: Customer Support Bot That Actually "Remembers" You
description: "Support chatbots with persistent user context and preferences"
---

## Scenario

SaaS product with an in-app / website support chatbot that needs to remember user context across conversations.

## Extraction

From chats, tickets, and events, GetProfile keeps a live profile per end-user:

- `plan_tier`: free / pro / enterprise
- `product_areas_used[]`: "billing", "integrations", "dashboards"
- `recurring_issues[]`: "confused about usage limits", "OAuth failures"
- `frustration_level`: low / medium / high
- `tone_preference`: patient explanations vs short answers

No one fills this out manually; it's inferred from conversations + app events.

## Injection

When the user talks to the bot again, calls go through the GetProfile proxy:

- It injects a short profile block into the system prompt:
  - "Pro-tier user, power user of integrations, recently frustrated about rate limits, prefers direct answers."

- It also injects a couple of **recent, high-signal memories**:
  - last failed integration attempt,
  - last time support promised a fix.

## Impact

The bot can:

- Skip basic docs if user is a power user.
- Preempt "we've had this issue before" with context.
- Use calmer, more careful language if `frustration_level` is high.

## Implementation

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
apiKey: process.env.GETPROFILE_API_KEY,
baseURL: 'https://api.yourserver.com/v1',
defaultHeaders: {
'X-GetProfile-Id': userId, // Your app's user ID
'X-Upstream-Key': process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
},
});

// Support bot conversation
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
model: 'gpt-5',
messages: [
{
role: 'system',
content: 'You are a helpful support agent. Be concise and technical for power users.',
},
{
role: 'user',
content: 'I keep getting rate limit errors on my API calls.',
},
],
});
// GetProfile automatically injects user profile and relevant memories

```
