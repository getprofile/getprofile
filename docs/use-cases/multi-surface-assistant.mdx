title: Multi-Surface Personal Assistant (Telegram, Web, Desktop)
description: "One personal AI that works consistently across all platforms"
---

## Scenario

One "personal AI" used across chat, browser extension, and desktop app that needs to maintain consistent context across all surfaces.

## Extraction

From all surfaces, GetProfile builds a single user profile:

- `life_domains[]`: work, fitness, finances, hobby projects
- `time_constraints`: works late, free on weekends, calls best in evenings
- `tool_preferences[]`: Notion, Google Calendar, Todoist, VSCode
- `planning_style`: likes detailed plans vs loose suggestions
- `privacy_boundaries`: topics user asked not to store or revisit

It learns these passively as the user chats and issues commands.

## Injection

Any time any surface calls an LLM:

- GetProfile's proxy injects:
  - "User is a freelance dev, uses Notion & Google Calendar, prefers weekly overview plans, often overwhelmed by too many micro tasks."

- It chooses a few cross-surface memories:
  - last week's goals,
  - tasks the user procrastinated on,
  - commitments noted in other channels.

## Impact

- The Telegram bot, desktop agent, and browser extension all "share a brain".
- The assistant proposes realistic plans and reminders consistent with how the user actually behaves, not just generic advice.

## Implementation

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
// Telegram Bot
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const telegramClient = new OpenAI({
apiKey: process.env.GETPROFILE_API_KEY,
baseURL: 'https://api.yourserver.com/v1',
defaultHeaders: {
'X-GetProfile-Id': userId,
'X-Upstream-Key': process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
},
});

// Browser Extension
const extensionClient = new OpenAI({
apiKey: process.env.GETPROFILE_API_KEY,
baseURL: 'https://api.yourserver.com/v1',
defaultHeaders: {
'X-GetProfile-Id': userId, // Same user ID
'X-Upstream-Key': process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
},
});

// Desktop App
const desktopClient = new OpenAI({
apiKey: process.env.GETPROFILE_API_KEY,
baseURL: 'https://api.yourserver.com/v1',
defaultHeaders: {
'X-GetProfile-Id': userId, // Same user ID
'X-Upstream-Key': process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
},
});

// All three clients share the same profile and memories
