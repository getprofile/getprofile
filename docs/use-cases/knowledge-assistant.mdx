title: Internal Knowledge Assistant Tailored to Each Employee
description: "Company AI assistants that adapt to each employee's role and expertise"
---

## Scenario

Internal "Ask AI" for company docs/code/processes that needs to adapt to each employee's role and knowledge level.

## Extraction

From questions, docs visited, and tools used, GetProfile creates:

- `department`, `team`, `role`
- `project_contexts[]`: which repos / services they touch
- `topic_familiarity`: "deep in payments service", "novice in infra", etc.
- `documentation_style_preference`: likes code samples vs concept docs

All inferred from their questions and link click patterns.

## Injection

When they ask, "How do I add a new metric to our billing pipeline?":

- GetProfile injects:
  - "User is on the billing team, familiar with service X but not Y; prefers answers with code snippets and direct links to runbooks."

- Plus a couple of relevant memories:
  - previous similar question and answer,
  - docs they read last time.

## Impact

- The assistant answers at the right depth and with the right references.
- Onboarding is smoother, since the assistant adapts to each newcomer over time.

## Implementation

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
apiKey: process.env.GETPROFILE_API_KEY,
baseURL: 'https://api.yourserver.com/v1',
defaultHeaders: {
'X-GetProfile-Id': employeeId,
'X-Upstream-Key': process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
},
});

// Knowledge base query
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
model: 'gpt-5',
messages: [
{
role: 'system',
content: 'You are an internal knowledge assistant. Provide answers at the appropriate depth for the employee\'s role and expertise.',
},
{
role: 'user',
content: 'How do I add a new metric to our billing pipeline?',
},
],
});
// GetProfile injects employee's role, expertise areas, and documentation preferences
